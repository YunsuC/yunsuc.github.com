## Poisson Blending

To perform Poisson Blending, we proceeded with the Toy Problem to restore the original image from zero image with minimal gradient from the original image.

To obtain an image satisfying all three equations, we wrote the source code as shown below.
Denote the intensity of the source image at (x,y) as s(x,y), and the values of the image to solve for as v(x,y).
